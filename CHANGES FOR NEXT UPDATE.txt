New Core Feature: 

Random Night Events. Sometimes, when night comes, random events can occur, sometimes dangerous, sometimes helpful, and sometimes... strange. No spoilers, but there are plenty of them!


New Mobs:

Adult Batalisks will now spawn from Bat Caves, and sometimes from open cave entrances
Scorpions now spawn in the desert during the daytime, burrow back into the ground at dusk
Pollen Mites. These aggressive bug clouds will latch onto a variety of mobs, causing them to enrage and target nearby players. If they latch onto a player, they will deal periodic damage and reduce the time until sneezing
Pollen Mite dens will appear during spring, and will grow, and spread, creating more dens. Fire can be helpful for dealing with the dens, but be careful when using fire around Pollen Mites themselves! I recommend the new Bug Zapper weapon against them both.
Pineling - Axe do an entry or leave it a suprise?
