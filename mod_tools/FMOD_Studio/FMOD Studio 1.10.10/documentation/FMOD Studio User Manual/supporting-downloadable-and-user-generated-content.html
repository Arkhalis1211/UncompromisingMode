<h1>11. Supporting Downloadable and User-generated Content</h1>
<p>Many game projects allow players to install <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#downloadable-content">downloadable content</span class="dead-link"> (DLC) or <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#user-generated-content">user-generated content</span class="dead-link"> (UGC) after initially installing the game. Such content then appears in the game alongside the content installed with the original version of the game.</p>
<p>FMOD Studio supports creating new audio content for use in both DLC and UGC. It does this by allowing you (or your game's content-creating users) to make <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a> and <a href="glossary.html#bus">buses</a> that can be built into <a href="glossary.html#bank">banks</a> and loaded alongside the other banks in your game.</p>
<p>Creating downloadable or user-generated content involves editing your existing FMOD Studio project. We therefore recommend creating a backup of your FMOD Studio project folder before you begin.</p>
<h2 id="dlc"><a href="#dlc">11.1 DLC</a></h2>
<p>FMOD Studio allows you to create new <a href="glossary.html#bank">bank</a> files and new versions of your existing bank files even after you game has been released. The only thing that sets a <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#downloadable-content">DLC</span class="dead-link"> bank apart from your game's existing banks is the fact that it is not distributed as part of your existing game. DLC banks can be loaded and used alongside your game's existing banks, and can contain new <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a> and <a href="glossary.html#bus">buses</a>, both of which can be <a href="glossary.html#routing">routed</a> into your game's existing buses.</p>
<h3 id="creating-dlc"><a href="#creating-dlc">11.1.1 Creating DLC</a></h3>
<p>The process of creating content for use in a DLC bank is exactly the same as the process used to create non-DLC content, and uses the same FMOD Studio project: Load your project in FMOD Studio, then begin importing <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">assets</a> and creating new events, banks, and buses. Events must be assigned to banks, and can be routed into new or existing <a href="glossary.html#group-bus">group buses</a> or the <a href="glossary.html#master-bus">master bus</a>. New buses can also be routed into existing group buses or the master bus.</p>
<p>When creating new events or editing existing events for inclusion in DLC, create or edit the events in your FMOD Studio project as usual. The new and edited events you create must all be assigned to banks.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is usually best to assign edited or newly created events to new banks. This is because much your existing banks also include unchanged content from your existing game, and including this unchanged content in your DLC increases the size of your built banks, and thus the size of the download, without providing your players with any new content.</li>
<li>Assigning edited or newly created events to existing banks may allow you to reduce the total size of your game after the DLC is downloaded, as the new banks can replace the existing banks instead of existing alongside them. This can occasionally be useful when making content for platforms with extremely limited storage space.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to be able to look up new events by name and path instead of by GUID in your game's code, you need to create an updated strings.bank file that contains the names and paths of the new events. This file is automatically created as part of building the master bank.</p>
<p>When adding new buses or editing existing buses for inclusion in DLC, you must build a new version of your master bank and distribute it. This is because the master bank contains the mixer.</p>
<p>If you want to minimise the size of the download, you can optionally delete everything except the new buses and the group buses into which they are routed, in order to create a version of your master bank that contains only new content and which must be loaded alongside your game's existing master bank to function. If you do this, you must change the master bank's GUID to be different to that of the master bank in your existing game, to ensure that both master banks can be loaded simultaneously. To change the GUID of your master bank, locate the .xml file corresponding to your master bank in your FMOD Studio project's "Metadata\Bank" subdirectory, then rename the file to a different GUID and edit its GUID property value to match using a text editor application.</p>
<p>Once you have created all content required for your DLC, build your FMOD Studio project. The built bank files for the modified and newly added banks can then be distributed as part of your game's DLC.</p>
<h2 id="ugc"><a href="#ugc">11.2 UGC</a></h2>
<p>If you want your players to be able to create original audio content that can be used in your game, you can give them a copy of your FMOD Studio  project with which they can make <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#user-generated-content">UGC</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p>A user with a UGC project can populate it with new content and use it to build <a href="glossary.html#bank">banks</a> compatible with your game. Like <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#downloadable-content">DLC</span class="dead-link"> banks, UGC banks can contain new <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a> and <a href="glossary.html#bus">buses</a>, both of which can be <a href="glossary.html#routing">routed</a> into your game's existing buses.</p>
<h3 id="creating-ugc"><a href="#creating-ugc">11.2.1 Creating UGC</a></h3>
<p>The process of creating UGC is exactly he same as the process of <a href="supporting-downloadable-and-user-generated-content.html#creating-dlc">creating DLC</a>, except that the content is created by your game's players instead of by you. As with creating DLC, your players must have a copy of your game's FMOD Studio project and the version of FMOD Studio used to create that project in order to create UGC compatible with your game.</p>
<p>If you want to limit your players' ability to edit your game's existing content, there are a number of ways to do that.</p>
<p>If you want to prevent players from editing your existing events, delete those events from the FMOD Studio project you provide to your players. Alternatively, you could always make sure to load your version of an event first. For more information on how bank load order affects which version of an event players hear, see the <a href="supporting-downloadable-and-user-generated-content.html#loading-dlc-and-ugc-banks">Loading DLC and UGC Banks</a> section of this chapter.</p>
<p>If you want to prevent players from creating new versions of your game's existing banks, delete those banks from the FMOD Studio project you provide to your players.</p>
<p>If you want to prevent players from editing your existing buses, delete your existing buses from the project. Note that the GUID of a UGC or DLC project's master bus must match that of the existing project's master bus, or the UGC or DLC buses will not be correctly appended to the existing buses when the project's master banks are loaded.</p>
<p>If you want your players to be able to create new buses or route their new events into your existing buses, you must change the GUID of the master bank in the project. This is because FMOD Studio cannot simultaneously load multiple master banks with the same GUID, but can load multiple master banks if their GUIDs differ. To change the GUID of your master bank, locate the .xml file corresponding to your master bank in your FMOD Studio project's "Metadata\Bank" subdirectory, then rename the file to a different GUID and edit its GUID property value to match using a text editor application.</p>
<h2 id="loading-dlc-and-ugc-banks"><a href="#loading-dlc-and-ugc-banks">11.3 Loading DLC and UGC Banks</a></h2>
<p>Under most circumstances, <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#downloadable-content">DLC</span class="dead-link"> and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#user-generated-content">UGC</span class="dead-link"> banks function just like other <a href="glossary.html#bank">banks</a>: They can be loaded, and then <a href="glossary.html#event-instance">instances</a> of the events in those banks can be played. For more information about loading banks and playing events, see the <a href="getting-events-into-your-game.html#what-building-creates">what building creates</a> and <a href="getting-events-into-your-game.html#playing-events">playing events</a> sections of the <a href="getting-events-into-your-game.html">getting events into your game</a> chapter, and the <a href="https://www.fmod.com/resources/documentation-api">FMOD Studio API manual</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, DLC and UGC <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#master-bank">master banks</span class="dead-link"> can contain additional <a href="glossary.html#mixer">mixer</a> content. If you load one or more UGC or DLC master banks after loading the game's existing master bank, the additional buses in the DLC or UGC master banks are automatically appended to the existing routing hierarchy.</p>
<p>If a DLC or UGC bank contains a modified version of a bus or event found in an existing bank, your game will use the version of that bus or event that is loaded first. If you load a DLC or UGC bank first, the version from that bank is used by your game that session; whereas if you load your game's existing bank first, the version from the existing bank is used in your game that session even if a DLC bank is loaded later.</p></div>
