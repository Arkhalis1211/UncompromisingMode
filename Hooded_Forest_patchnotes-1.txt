1a- NEW BIOME: "THE HOODED FOREST"

- Giant Trees (Chop to get lots of wood and twigs, but look out for things that live inside. Can get infested. The large canopy it supports protects the forest from smoldering.)
- Giant Ferns (Take a guess.)
- Boomberries (A new source of food. You have to be careful when extracting them.)
- Unique Set Pieces
- Replaces the Moonbase forest in worldgen. (The Moonbase and guaranteed Mactusk camp now spawn in the Hooded Forest.)

- Snapdragons (New Herd-type mob. Feed it stuff depending on life stage to get an alternative method of farming crops.)
- Fruit Bats (A new neutral mob that eats bugs.)
- Aphids (New type of bug.)
- Pitcher Plant (The Fruit Bat's home. If the Fruit Bat eats enough bugs, it will produce honey.)

- Hooded Widow (New Boss!)
- Webbed Cocoons (Can be cracked opened using a Hooded Widow drop.)
- Hooded Forest now snuffs out smoldering.

2a - KOALEFANT CHANGES
We put emphasis on the koalefant in particular because we have completely revamped the fight against it. 
It's a perfect example on what fighting will look in the Combat Update. We're open to feedback, as always.

- Koalefants have a small chance to counter-attack when hit, disrupting the kiting pattern.
- Koalefants now have a chance to charge at the player. This is telegraphed by it dragging it's hoof on the ground.
- Koalefants will occasionally honk their nose with extreme volume, knocking the player's weapon out of their hand.

2b - MAJOR CHANGES

- The Breezy Vest now has 6 inventory slots, along with having 120 insulation (from 60.) Also has 30% Wetness resistance (from 20%.)
- The Puffy Vest and Summer Frest now have 4 inventory slots.

- The overlay for snowstorms are now more transparent.
- Toadstool now spawns in mushtree biomes.

- Crafting Recipes added by Uncompromising Mode are no longer at the bottom of each crafting tab. Instead, they have been organized alongside vanilla items.

- Moon Tears can be exchanged for Iridesant Gems at the Moonbase. This is most likely temporary until an actual use for the Moon Tear is made (or Klei adds an alternative).

2c - MINOR CHANGES

- The Marsh now has thick fog. Spooky. (It also has bushes, which are currently decoration.)
- Characters have an additional quote line when examining an antihistamine (ex: honey.)
- Spiders, Birchnutters, Moles, Beeguards, and bats now drop souls again.
- Warly now gets 20% more hunger from food (was 15%.)
- Wormwood's "Honey Log Roll" has a new sprite.
- Rot now drains health and sanity when eaten.
- Juicy Berry Bushes no longer have a chance to spawn mosquitos when harvested. (Good idea on paper, made juicy berry worlds god awful to play.)
- Juicy Berry Bushes will now yield one less batch of berries on average before needing to be fertilized.
- Updated the Veteran's Curse mouseover text.
- The Shadow Arena RNE no longer spawns a harmful lightning strike when arriving at your teleport location.
- If a player sneezes outside of Spring for whatever reason (ex: logged out during spring, came back during Summer), they will be cleared of Hayfever.

3a - BUG FIXES

- Swapped the data name for the "caveless option" from "caveless" to "caved" (IF YOU ARE RUNNING A DEDICATED SERVER MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THIS CONFIG OPTION. Previously, doing caveless = true would mean that you are running a server with caves, and vice versa. It was confusing and dumb.)

- Acid Rain has been fixed up, hopefully.
- Beefalo now do damage on contact when charging. They didn't do so before, which was unintentional. This also applies to the Koalefant.
- Certain Cave RNEs will disappear when the night phase ends.
- Players can now interact with snow piles at a slightly longer distance. Previously, large/modded structures blocked players from clearing out the snow.
- Sneezing should no longer rubberband the player.
- Several Abominamoles can't spawn from a single snow pile anymore.
- Added .1 second delay to all RNEs that fail to spawn their prefabs and have to retry, mitigating the risk of a memory stack overflow.
- Fixed Mr. Skitts RNE.
- Fixed a crash related to Woby's new enemy avoidance code
- Toadlings no longer attack birds
