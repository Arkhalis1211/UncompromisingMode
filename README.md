## Mod Collab Change Guidelines

```
1  - Preserve as much as possible the core DST mechanics (the game should still feel like vanilla DST).
2  - Avoid introducing new characters or biomes.
3  - Increase the overall difficulty of the game, while being fair.
4  - Emphasize skill in the design.
5  - Tune and tweak all mechanics that do not fit the Uncompromising theme.
6  - Changes should be visible from in-game and clear, without needing to consult a changelist.
7  - Tailor changes for Veteran players.
8  - Focus on replicating a similar Don't Starve experience as the first time we played this game and everything was new, but for veterans.
9  - Changes must be community driven and voted by the community and approved by the Uncompromising team contributors collectively.
10 - Keep things lore friendly. All changes must fit in the Klei universe.
```
